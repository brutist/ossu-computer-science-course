1. What were your results from compare_cow_transport_algorithms? 
Which algorithm runs faster? Why?

'''
Using compare_cow_transport_algorithms, I have found out that the execution time of the 
greedy algorithm is so minuscule, it may as well be zero, for the given data (ps1_cow_data.txt)
This stems from the fact that;
a. There are only a handful cows (11).
b. My implementation of greedy algorithm's time complexity is 0(n^2).

This is in stark contrast with the brute force method that takes about half a second to run.

2. Does the greedy algorithm return the optimal solution? Why/why not?

3. Does the brute force algorithm return the optimal solution? Why/why no
